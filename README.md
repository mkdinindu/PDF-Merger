A pdf merger using python3 library PyPDF2.
system argv library is used to pass input values through terminal interfaces so this can be used as terminal command easily.
Build this because some times lecturers upload lecture notes in seperate pdf files like part 1 part 2 which are supposed to be in same topic.

move this setup file "merge_pdf" to the local/bin folder of urs and make it executable **"chmod +x ~/bin/merge_pdfs"**

command structure 
**merge_pdf pdf1.pdf pdf2.pdf -o outputfileName**
